## How to Run

To test any of the calculators:

1. Open the relevant JavaScript file in a browser environment or use a tool like [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) or [CodePen](https://codepen.io/).
2. Each script uses `prompt()` to ask for input and `console.log()` to display the output.
3. Open the browser's developer console to view results.

> Note: If you're using Node.js, youâ€™ll need to modify the prompt section to use `readline` or another input method.
